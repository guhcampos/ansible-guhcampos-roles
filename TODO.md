### Consider fixing podman?

On the move back from podman to docker I likely broke the podman stuff, might
want to fix it if anyone else is ever going to use this or I change my mind
again

### Cleanup Unused Apps

Haven't used these in a while, likely broken, got to either fix or remove them:

- archivebox
- grafana
- heimdall
- homarr
- mariadb
- netdata
- portainer
- rclone
- redis
- syncthing
- youtubedl
